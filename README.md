Canonical Pydantic schemas for computer-use agents.

```
pip install openadapt-types
```

These are the shared `Action` and UI-state types used across the OpenAdapt
stack: recorders emit them, the compiler stores and replays them, the grounding
package resolves their targets, and the privacy package scrubs them. Defining the
schema once keeps every substrate (web, Windows, macOS, Linux, RDP, Citrix/VDI)
on the same contract.

## The OpenAdapt stack

OpenAdapt is a governed demonstration compiler: record a workflow once, compile
the recording into a deterministic program, and replay that program with zero
model calls on the healthy path. When the live screen does not match what was
demonstrated it halts instead of guessing, using identity gates and independent
effect verification. Every substrate is first-class.

Substrate maturity, stated the same way across the OpenAdapt repositories:

| Substrate | Maturity |
| --- | --- |
| Browser (web) | Beta; available in production today through the managed browser product |
| Native desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux) | Available for customer-controlled execution; qualification evidence is task- and environment-specific |
| Remote display (RDP) | Available for customer-controlled execution; qualification evidence is task- and environment-specific |
| Citrix / VDI | Available for customer-controlled execution; real-environment ICA/HDX qualification is deployment-specific |

The packages in the stack:

| Package | Role |
| --- | --- |
| [`openadapt`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/OpenAdapt) | Launcher and installer (`pip install openadapt`) |
| [`openadapt-flow`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-flow) | Records, compiles, verifies, and replays workflows |
| [`openadapt-capture`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-capture) | Cross-platform local desktop recording |
| **`openadapt-types`** | Canonical action and UI-state schema (this package) |
| [`openadapt-grounding`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-grounding) | Local OCR text-anchoring plus optional model grounding |
| [`openadapt-privacy`](https://github.com/OpenAdaptAI/openadapt-privacy) | PHI/PII detection and redaction |

Documentation for the whole stack lives at

## What's in the box

| Schema | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `ComputerState` | Screen state: screenshot + UI element graph + window context |
| `UINode` | Single UI element with role, bbox, hierarchy, platform anchors |
| `Action` | Agent action with typed action space + flexible targeting |
| `ActionTarget` | Where to act: `node_id` > `description` > `(x, y)` coordinates |
| `ActionResult` | Execution outcome with error taxonomy + state delta |
| `Episode` / `Step` | Complete task trajectory (observation → action → result) |
| `FailureRecord` | Classified failure for dataset pipelines |
| `ControlOverlayFrameV1` / `ControlOverlayTimelineV1` | PHI-safe execution overlay state bound to exact evidence media |
| `ControlOverlayFrameV2` / `ControlOverlayTimelineV2` | Exact, privacy-safe target geometry for sibling overlays and media composition |
| `ExecuteRequestV1` / `ExecuteStatusV1` | Async qualified-execution request and lifecycle contracts |
| `ExecuteEvidenceReceiptV1` | Outcome receipt with contract proof and evidence identifiers |
| `EffectStrengthV1` | Named effect-proof strength for consequential execution |
| `BusinessDecisionTaskV1` / `BusinessDecisionAnswerV1` | Signed, finite business choices for authenticated mobile or local operator routes |
| `BusinessDecisionAnswerReceiptV1` | Runner answer receipt that cannot claim a verified business effect |

## Quick start

```python
from openadapt_types import (
    Action, ActionTarget, ActionType,
    ComputerState, UINode, BoundingBox,
)

# Describe what's on screen
state = ComputerState(
    viewport=(1920, 1080),
    nodes=[
        UINode(node_id="n0", role="window", name="My App", children_ids=["n1"]),
        UINode(node_id="n1", role="button", name="Submit", parent_id="n0",
               bbox=BoundingBox(x=500, y=400, width=100, height=40)),
    ],
)

# Agent decides what to do
action = Action(
    type=ActionType.CLICK,
    target=ActionTarget(node_id="n1"),
    reasoning="Click Submit to proceed",
)

# Render element tree for LLM prompts
print(state.to_text_tree())
# [n0] window: My App
#   [n1] button: Submit
```

## Action targeting

`ActionTarget` supports three grounding strategies (in priority order):

```python
# 1. Element-based (preferred, most robust)
ActionTarget(node_id="n1")

# 2. Description-based (resolved by grounding module)
ActionTarget(description="the blue submit button")

# 3. Coordinate-based (fallback)
ActionTarget(x=550, y=420)
ActionTarget(x=0.29, y=0.39, is_normalized=True)
```

Agents SHOULD produce `node_id` or `description`. The runtime resolves to coordinates.

## Compatibility with existing schemas

Converters for three existing OpenAdapt schema formats:

```python
from openadapt_types._compat import (
    from_benchmark_observation,   # openadapt-evals BenchmarkObservation
    from_benchmark_action,        # openadapt-evals BenchmarkAction
    from_ml_observation,          # openadapt-ml Observation
    from_ml_action,               # openadapt-ml Action
    from_omnimcp_screen_state,    # omnimcp ScreenState
    from_omnimcp_action_decision, # omnimcp ActionDecision
)

# Convert existing data
state = from_benchmark_observation(obs.__dict__)
action = from_benchmark_action(act.__dict__)
```

## JSON Schema

Export for language-agnostic tooling:

```python
import json
from openadapt_types import ComputerState, Action, Episode

# Get JSON Schema
schema = ComputerState.model_json_schema()
print(json.dumps(schema, indent=2))
```

The same API exports the versioned cross-surface overlay contracts:

```python
from openadapt_types import (
    ControlOverlayFrameV1,
    ControlOverlayFrameV2,
    ControlOverlayTimelineV1,
    ControlOverlayTimelineV2,
)

frame_schema = ControlOverlayFrameV1.model_json_schema()
timeline_schema = ControlOverlayTimelineV1.model_json_schema()
tracking_frame_schema = ControlOverlayFrameV2.model_json_schema()
tracking_timeline_schema = ControlOverlayTimelineV2.model_json_schema()
```

The same schemas ship under `openadapt_types/schemas/` for TypeScript, Rust,
and other consumers. Version 1 remains the control-state contract. Version 2
adds an optional normalized top-level viewport rectangle, the exact source
viewport and DPR, and an exact observation or decoded-media-frame binding
without changing V1.

Overlay schemas reject unknown fields and contain only closed presentation
labels and canonical statuses. Screenshot payloads, action-target selectors,
accessible names, text and values, typed input, identities, URLs, logs, report
bodies, and user-authored workflow names remain outside this public contract.
V2 may carry only normalized target geometry from a browser top-level CSS
viewport. Native and RDP device-pixel geometry is not part of this V2 schema.

Target geometry never carries locators, accessible names, values, URLs, or
screenshots. A private live observation uses a run/export-scoped HMAC reference
instead of a linkable raw frame hash. Published media uses the exact media
SHA-256 and decoded frame index. A renderer draws tracking only when that
binding matches; it omits the rectangle rather than replaying selectors,
interpolating movement, or inferring a missing target from adjacent events.
The runtime does not guess a future viewer transform. Desktop, Cloud, and media
renderers map the normalized rectangle through their actual content box.
If multiple runtime states land in one decoded media frame, the producer must
coalesce them deterministically; it must not invent extra media frames or
approximate their timing.

`openadapt_types/schemas/execute-v1-openapi.json` is the public OpenAdapt
Execute v1 contract. It defines asynchronous execution submission, lifecycle
status, terminal evidence receipts, and signed decision and terminal webhooks.
It keeps `waiting_for_reconciliation` as a lifecycle state and
`reconciliation_required` as a terminal outcome.

The separate `business-decision-*-v1.json` files define a finite human branch
that the workflow declared before execution. They do not reuse the operational
halt actions. They carry only opaque bindings, option IDs, digests, counts, and
closed status values. The reviewed question and option text live in a
presentation artifact whose digest is bound by the signed delivery policy.
Screenshots and live record values stay on the customer runner. An accepted
answer only selects a compiled branch. The next action must still pass its
live-state, identity, policy, and effect contracts.

## OpenAdapt Execute v1

OpenAdapt Execute is the public asynchronous contract for a qualified
workflow. A partner sends an authorized request, receives an execution ID, and
then reads a terminal receipt or receives a signed webhook. The contract does
not expose a runner, customer data, evidence bytes, application recipes, or
Cloud control-plane internals.

The generated OpenAPI document is packaged at
`openadapt_types/schemas/execute-v1-openapi.json`. The package also includes a
small Python client. The reference Python and TypeScript clients are in
[`examples/execute`](examples/execute/). Use `https://app.openadapt.ai/api` as
the OpenAdapt Cloud base URL. It uses a partner-provisioned bearer token and
the client appends the stable `/v1` paths.
The client requires an HTTPS base URL and rejects redirects before it can send
the bearer token to another endpoint.

```python
from openadapt_types import ExecuteClient

client = ExecuteClient(
    base_url="https://app.openadapt.ai/api",
    bearer_token="partner-provisioned-token",
)
```

The client does not poll forever. A workflow can wait for a human decision or
reconciliation. Use the terminal receipt or signed webhook as the completion
signal.

## Design principles

- **Pydantic v2**: runtime validation, JSON Schema export, fast serialization
- **Pixels and structure**: always capture both visual and semantic UI state
- **Node graph**: full element tree, not just the focused element
- **Platform-agnostic**: same schema for web, Windows, macOS, Linux, RDP, Citrix/VDI
- **Extension-friendly**: `raw`, `attributes`, `metadata` fields everywhere
- **Backward compatible**: `_compat` converters for gradual migration

## Dependencies

Just `pydantic>=2.0`. No ML libraries, no heavy deps.
